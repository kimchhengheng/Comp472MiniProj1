Does the same model give you the same performance every time?
When I Redo steps 6 for 10 time in the loop, the result is exactly the same becuase the 
model never create new, it reuse the same instance over again with the same train and test portion. 
Becuase the split just seperate the test data from train data.

However, I got different result when I run cross validation data. Cross validation provide the ability
to split the data into portion. Each time the program run the model would use different test and train data.
This lead to different numerical value.
